``` git branch feature && git checkout feature```
* then began our work through the project when we finshed we used:
``` git add . && git commit -m "final version" ```
* we meged our local main and feature branch using the following:
``` git checkout main && git merge feature ```
* we check the status on main to make sure we added and commit our work.
